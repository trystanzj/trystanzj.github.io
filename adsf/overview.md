# Automated Decision Support

The Farly Automated Decision Support Framework (ADSF) is for offline firewall configuration monitoring.

The Farly ADSF applications are database driven, network topology aware, and network integrated. The Farly ADSF applications can be used for manual or automated firewall rule analysis, auditing, policy standardization, optimisation and configuration updates. 

The Farly ADSF can use load balancer style active network probes to automatically ensure, with certainty, that the network firewall configurations are in sync with ongoing changes in the network, such as server and application moves or retirements.

When fully automated, and with minimal human intervention, the Farly ADSF will use the most recent version of the network firewall configurations to ensure that the firewalls are:

* Optimised and error free;
* Compliant with organizational firewall security policy requirements;
* And not referencing retired hosts or services within managed networks;

If any issues with the firewall configurations are found an email detailing the problem and solution (i.e. a firewall configuration change) can be emailed to firewall administrators for investigation and implementation.
