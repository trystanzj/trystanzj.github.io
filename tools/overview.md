# Farly Tools

Farly Tools are Perl scripts which simplify firewall management tasks such as firewall audits, optimizations, cleanups, and configuration rewrites. Farly Tools are the simplest way to get started with Farly.

All Farly Tools load a single firewall configuration file as input and generate simple text reports. They import and analyze one firewall configuration file each time they are run. Farly Tools can display the commands required to fix the firewall configuration issues discovered.

Farly Tools support Cisco ASA version 7.2 and higher as well as Cisco FWSM 3.x and higher. Version 0.25 of the Firewall Analysis and Rewrite Library (Farly) is required.

Farly Tools can be run on any operating system supporting Perl 5.
